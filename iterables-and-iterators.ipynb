    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterables\n",
    "An iter**able** is any object you can call `iter` on to produce an iterator.\n",
    "In plainer terms, it's pretty much any object you can loop over with a `for ... in ...` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterators\n",
    "An iter**ator** is an object that you can repeatedly call `next` on to produce values one at a time,\n",
    "perhaps until it runs out of values and raises a `StopIteration` exception.\n",
    "The gist is that iterators are streams of data: they produce values one at time, and they don't store their previous values.\n",
    "By convention, every iterator is also an iterable, and calling `iter` on an iterator returns the same iterator you started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generators\n",
    "As we'll see below, implementing our own iterators from scratch can be a little more verbose than we might like.\n",
    "Generators are a special case of iterators, but they are meant to be friendlier to write. That's all.\n",
    "There are two kinds of generators: generator functions and generator expressions.\n",
    "Generator functions use function definition syntax to create iterators,\n",
    "while generator expressions use a list comprehension style syntax to create iterators.\n",
    "If you need to write your own iterator, you'll probably use a generator for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recap\n",
    "Calling `iter` on an iterable produces an iterator. Every iterator is itself an iterable,\n",
    "because calling `iter` on an iterator returns that same iterator (`iter` is idempotent).\n",
    "Generators are iterators, and thus they are also iterables. \n",
    "Iterators are streams of data.\n",
    "You can access the next value of an iterator with `next`,\n",
    "but most of the time you'll use a loop or some other higher-level construct."

    "I'll show exactly how for loops work in the iterator section.\n",
    "After we've talked about iterators, I can show how to build your own iterables and iterators.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far I've just shown examples of iterables and iterators arising from the basic container types in Python.\n",
    "Now I'll show how create your own iterables and iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I've said so many times now, an iterable is something that produces an iterator when `iter` is called on it.\n",
    "So if we're writing a class, and we want it to be iterable, we just need to make sure `iter` works the way we want on our class.\n",
    "There are two ways to do this.\n",
    "The most direct way is to implement the `__iter__` method inside the class.\n",
    "This directly corresponds to the `iter` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way is to implement the `__getitem__` method.\n",
    "`x.__getitem__(i)` directly corresponds to `x[i]`.\n",
    "If we've implemented `__getitem__`, then calling `iter` will try to create an iterator by feeding in the indices\n",
    "`0, 1, 2, ...` to `__getitem__` and will raise a `StopIteration` exception when `__getitem__` raises an `IndexError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can't really make an iterable if we don't know how to make an iterator.\n",
    "So let's discuss that quickly.\n",
    "Just like `iter` and `__iter__`, we can define how the `next` function works for a class by implementing the `__next__` method.\n",
    "We just need to make sure that `__next__` raises `StopIteration` when (and if) we want the iterator to stop.\n",
    "That's really all there is to it.\n",

    "Whatever is `yield`ed is the first value of that iterator.\n",

    "This continues until the generator function `return`s any value (it doesn't matter what value is returned),\n",
    "if ever, and then the iterator raises a `StopIteration` exception.\n",
    "In the generator function example above, there is an implicit `return None` after the end of the for loop,\n",
    "since every function without a `return` statement implicitly has `return None` at the very end of the function body.\n",

    "In short, generator functions run until a `yield` statment and then save their state and pause until we ask for the next value.\n",

    "Generator functions are a great way write concise iterators.\n",

    "That's some beautiful and terse code, in my opinion. \n",

    "Unfortunately it is also some very slow code. Every time we reach the `yield from` line we spin up two more `fib()` generators. It has the same terrible exponential time complexity as a naive fibonacci implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we can do better. We don't need two whole copies of `fib()` for the `yield from` step. If we could somehow couple the two generators so that they both get their values from the same source, but just with one of them one step behind, then we could avoid the exponential blow up. The `tee` function from `itertools` does exactly this. It creates copies of an iterator which then all share the resources of the original iterator. Values produced by the iterator but not yet consumed by all the copies wait in a queue. Once every copy has advanced beyond a value, it is no longer stored. `tee` is perfect for our use case, since our copies will only ever be one value apart. If, however, we made copies of an iterator with `tee` and then one advanced through all the values, while the other hadn't advanced at all, then this would be space equivalent to just storing the iterator in a list to begin with. Thus, `tee` only helps when we expect there to be no badly 'lagging' copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final modification, I'll also swap out the `zip` generator expression for a `map`, just to show another way to achieve the same thing and because it ends up being a litle bit shorter. By the way, `zip` and `map` both return iterators, which is the only way they could possibly work on these infinite iterators. I used to be annoyed that `zip` and `map` wouldn't just give me a list, but now I appreciate the power of iterators.\n",
